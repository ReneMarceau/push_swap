# push_swap - 42 School Project

## About

* This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.

* The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted.  
You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.  

* The goal ?  
Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the instructions, that sort the integers received as arguments.

* The learning objectives of this project are rigor, use of C and use of basic algorithms. Especially looking at the complexity of these basic algorithms.

* Within your mandatory part you are allowed to use the following functions:  
malloc, free, exit, write, read

## Operations

* The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a.  
* To do this you have the following operations at your disposal:

| Operations | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| sa | swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a |
| sb | swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b |
| ss | sa and sb at the same time |
| pa | push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a |
| pb | push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b |
| ra | rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one |
| rb | rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one |
| rr | ra and rb at the same time |
| rra | reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one |
| rrb | reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one |
| rrr | rra and rrb at the same time |

## Approach for Algorithm

1. I go through stack A looking for a sequenece of numbers that is already in ascending order.
2. I keep this sequenece of numbers in stack A and push all other elements to stack B.
3. Before performing any further Operations, i calculate for every single element in Stack B how many operations it would need to get to it's correct position in stack A.
4. I choose the element on stack B, that needs the fewest amount of Operations. Then I perform the Operations that are required to get it to the correct position in stack A.
5. I repeat step 3 and step 4 until stack A is sorted and stack B is empty.
6. Now i only need to align stack A, which means rotating it until the smallest element is at the top.

## Grading

* Sorting 100 numbers:
* I achieve an average of 600 Operations
  
| Operations | Points |
| :---: | :---: |
| less then 700 | 5 |
| less then 900 | 4 |
| less then 1100 | 3 |
| less then 1300 | 2 |
| less then 1500 | 1 |

* Sorting 500 numbers: 
* I achieve an average of 5400 Operations 

| Operations | Points |
| :---: | :---: |
| less then 5500 | 5 |
| less then 7000 | 4 |
| less then 8500 | 3 |
| less then 10000 | 2 |
| less then 11500 | 1 |

## Bonus

* The Bonus exercise was to write a Program called 'checker' that can read the Operations from stdin and perform them on a stack of numbers.
* checker will return 'KO' when the given Operations will sort the numbers in ascending order. Otherwise it returns 'KO'.
* In case of an error (f.ex. Operations doesn't exist) it returns 'Error'.

## How to use

Clone the repository:
```bash
https://github.com/42akurz/42_push_swap.git
```
Go to the repository and run make
```bash
make
```
run make bonus to compile checker files
```bash
make bonus
```
Call the executable together with a set of numbers seperated by a space
```bash
./push_swap 10 7 8 2 3 6 1 4 9 5
```
To run the checker on push swap, use the pipe operator
```bash
ARG="10 7 8 2 3 6 1 4 9 5"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./CHECKER $ARG
```
Use clean to delete all object files, fclean to remove all object files and executable and re to recompile the program
```bash
make clean / make fclean / make re
```
